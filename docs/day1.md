# Day 1 Reflection

## What I set up
- WSL Ubuntu environment
- Installed Azure CLI, Terraform, and Git
- Created a DevOps learning repository

## One thing I already knew
- Basic Azure concepts and CLI usage

## One thing that felt unclear
- How Terraform state is managed and shared in team environments
